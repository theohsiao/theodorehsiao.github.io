    <h3>This is the beginning of my journey</h3>
    <p>I first started my career in 2015 as an employee for Astrey as an EMT at Google. This was their IT Support position. Things progressed and stayed there for about a year and was able to pick up the experience of technical support and understanding the different functions of the teams in the IT world.</p>
